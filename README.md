# Triangle-game
The Funny Triangle game
This is a funny game which I stumbled upon watching a computerphile video in YouTube

I tried to do the same using codes

Algorithm:-
Take three points to form a triangle
Randomly select a starting point
Randomly select one of the three vertices
Move half the distance from the current position to the selected vertex
Plot the current position
Repeate from step 3
Soon you will notice an interesting pattern from the points.
