# Triangle-game
The Funny Triangle game
This is a funny game which I stumbled upon watching a computerphile video in YouTube

I tried to do the same using codes

Algorithm:-

1.Take three points to form a triangle

2.Randomly select a starting point

3.Randomly select one of the three vertices

4.Move half the distance from the current position to the selected vertex

5.Plot the current position

6.Repeate from step 3

7.Soon you will notice an interesting pattern from the points.
